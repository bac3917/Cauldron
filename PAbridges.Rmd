```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(RSocrata)
library(plyr)
# Pa Structurally Deficient  Bridges API Endpoint "https://data.pa.gov/resource/naza-5mua.json"
## Here's my RSocrata R query.
PAbridges<- read.socrata("https://data.pa.gov/resource/naza-5mua.json")
(nrow(bridge_query))
 
```


```{r basics}
count(PAbridges$year_built)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
