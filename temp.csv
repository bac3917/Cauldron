2030,it was a great presentation.,17457
2018,It was a great presentation!!!Thank you!,17005
2020,It was a great idea to include a participant within your presentation. Nicely done. The only thing I would change would be the length of time for the break- out session. It felt a bit too long.,17149
2015,"It seemed like this discussion triggered multiple participants. I appreciate that the presenters encouraged listeners to seek professional help if they need it. That said, it might be helpful in future years to have an ""aftercare"" session for those that need to debrief a deep conversation prior to moving to the next conference session.",17160
2009,It is always nice to see what other home visiting programs are doing.  It was nice hearing how they adapted to working during Covid.  Sharing makes you feel less alone in your challenges.,20804
2006,information was too general. And did not include anything new to the profession. We are professionals and know how to treat families  when working and interacting with families.,16542
2015,"I'm no longer accepting the things I cannot change.. I'm changing the things I cannot change
Angela Davis

Thanks for the safe space  place to talk",17128
2030,I would like a copy of this sessiom,17450
2010,I would have loved more ideas on specific activities other than PAT.  Ones that worked really with your families.,16707
2010,"I wish this session was more interactive. I enjoyed the panelists who shared their experiences, I just wish we would have had a chance to go into breakout rooms and collaborate with other Parent Educators. I was also confused because the email I received said that the session was until 3:30 pm but the host ended the meeting at 3:00 p.m.  Unsure if it was just a typo... but I would have enjoyed having extra time to connect with other educators all over the state. Thanks!",16767
2019,"I was hoping the info would have been centered a bit more for the entire state , not just the city area. I live in wherever and work 
The",17090

2024,I really enjoyed being able to discuss both problems and solutions with others,17208
2004,I really enjoy this workshop. I feel like it made me think and brought a new and fresh perspective to topics that have been discussed before but made you dig a little deeper into my thoughts and feelings,16472
2020,I really appreciated having Michael share his story.  It really opened up a new perspective for me and conversations that I feel are organic in nature to have with moms and the big piece that is missing for the fathers in our program.,17127
2040,I never understand why there are so many folks who speak before the presenter. I'm not trying to be mean but there was no further context the first 3 or 4 presenters provided it just seemed like the higher-ups wanted to show their face. I would have loved to have a longer session with Carl and have break out rooms to talk about how we can all advocate/push back on the systems our families are a part of instead of spending time doing other things.  Thanks for bringing Carl to us.,17759
2002,I may have misunderstood the session description.  It was a little different than I expected but overall it was good information.,16431
2027,I loved this!  It was a lovely way to end this long Zoom day!,17379

2013,I love the session. It is informative and well-prepared. The presenters were very knowledgeable on the topic and invited me to engage in thought-provoking self-reflection. I would recommend other people to attend a similar session.,16965
2025,"I love the session because it is pertinent to the reality of our society. However, maybe it could give more recommendations on pedagogical practices. I am still confused about what teachers could do if they have multi-language learners who speak different primary languages. Is it practical to do immersion programs or are we expecting teachers to know more than one language nowadays? I agree that the US is a language graveyard because many of my Chinese friends told me their children lost Chinese almost completely after coming to the U.S. despite their Chinese proficiency was excellent beforehand. What is a realistic solution? I look forward to seeing more research be done to address the gap and more realistic recommendations made to the schools.",17361
2001,"I love the message of HOPE. 

The information around Post Traumatic Growth was new and exciting to hear.",16365

2030,I love it Fill up to feel up safe socks !!!!Love myself ---WE WE #WE,17440
2006,I love anything about Protective Factors!  The presenter was pleasant and easy to understand. The workshop had a nice flow.,16507
2030,i liked the references to the resources / research.,17524
2006,I liked the positivity that we have to help children thrive through the assistance of positive parents; a goal that we as agencies strive to succeed at.,16433
2020,"I liked that this presentation had participant engagement into the breakout rooms and also enjoyed having Michael share his story.  As for learning how to engage fathers in my program, I didn’t learn as much as I was hoping to. Maybe in the future, the presentation could focus more on what curriculums are available for fathers. The presenters mentioned the 24/7 fatherhood program but didn’t really explain WHAT it teaches or how to get fathers to engage. Thank you .",17161
2003,I left feeling very positive and full of hope!,16539
2005,I learned some new strategies to use with the kids and families I work with.  I learned new strategies I can use to prevent burn out and fatigue,16449
2019,"I just loved this workshop - it is my favorite so far!  It was so relatable - the personal stories and connections each speaker shared made me say ""yes, I know what you are talking about!"".  It also gave me some good insight to help as a parent educator.

If anyone of the speakers ever has a bad day, just think of how much Philly needs your program!  And if you think that any of your enrolled families are not grateful, they are.  They will realize it sooner or later!

Could you forward this to the speakers?  Thank you so much.

2007,I enjoyed that we could just unmute ourselves and participate.,16576
2035,"I enjoyed hearing about this site, however I would like to see more information for younger children as our PAT program services children 0-5",17563
2036,I enjoyed Esther’s presentation & thought she shared a wealth of knowledge with the participants regarding Self-awareness and the protective factors. I really wish we would have had time to get into the breakout groups and go over the scenarios . I would have gladly stuck around for another 10-15 minutes to be able to get some hands on learning.

2021,I appreciate hearing from so many different folks on the team. I think some time to figure out how it could work in different spaces could have been helpful but I intend to reach out to brainstorm alongside these beautiful leaders.,17181

It really fortifies the work.",16390
