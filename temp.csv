I am still confused about what teachers could do if they have multi-language learners who speak different primary languages. Is it practical to do immersion programs or are we expecting teachers to know more than one language nowadays? I agree that the US is a language graveyard because many of my Chinese friends told me their children lost Chinese almost completely after coming to the U.S. despite their Chinese proficiency was excellent beforehand. What is a realistic solution? I look forward to seeing more research be done to address the gap and more realistic recommendations made to the schools.",17361,0
